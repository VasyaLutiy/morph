# Task template (`docs/TASK_<phase>_<component>.md`)

> The spec of one phase. The card breakdown is never written here: that is the deck, cut by `morph plan` from the record
> and `morph-map.json`. The spec is the contract a reader understands months later.

## 1. Why this

The motive with numbers (what reddens, how often, measured where; which issue). No number, no section. For a Component
that grows: its record size before and after (bytes of its block in `contour.yaml`, limit 30 KB).

## 2. Contract

### 2.1. INPUT data shapes the code must build

For every shape the code or a test must **construct or parse**: what it looks like and which module or file defines it;
that module is in the slice of every card that builds it.

**Fixtures are described by type, not by name:**

- Every fixture is described by the **type the Function takes** — one object or an array, text or parsed, one file or a
  tree — and by **what each Function returns on it, counted** ("three hazards: write-write a,b; read-write c,a; ...").
- A file is called an example's input **only if it is exactly that input**. Otherwise say which element of which file
  holds the example's `given` literal, or that the example has no file and its literal lives in the record.
- Every count and every illustration is **checked against the code or a spike before the gate**.
- Text an environment can change (a runtime's error message, a locale, a path separator, a file mode under a umask) is
  pinned by prefix or by rule, never verbatim.

**Declared dependencies:**

- A Function whose code imports a library names it through its Component's `uses`; the library is declared in the
  record with an exact version and an API digest (`docs/PLAN.md` "Dependencies"). §2.1 lists the calls the code makes
  into it, as in the digest, and every example's literal is measured on the declared version.
- The guard allows exactly the declared names in the code files of the Components that use them; tests keep the test
  framework and the shared helpers only. Acceptances run offline (Go: `-mod=vendor`, `GOPROXY=off`).

**A judge's setup across Components:**

- **Preconditions of the callees.** When the judged Function calls Functions of other Components, list every fact a
  test's setup depends on, as "<Component> · <fact> · what happens without it"; each example that needs it cites it.
- **Distinct markers.** Strings a test or an acceptance looks for are distinct and none is a substring of another.
- **A harness skeleton, not a prohibition list.** A judge whose setup builds more than a literal (a tree, a repository,
  a transport, a clock) gets a skeleton of ≤ 10 lines here, built only from the shared helpers module.
- **Output budget from the answer.** Each card's `max_tokens` in `morph-map.json` is sized from the expected file
  (code ≈ 12 000, judges 16 000–24 000, a judge answering ~20 KB ≥ 28 000; the judge with the most examples ≥ 20 000),
  before any processor factor.

### 2.2. OUTPUT data shapes

The exact shape of every result: the exported signatures as code, every union as literals, every message text pinned or
pinned by prefix, every ordering rule, every default. One table per Function: example → given → result. Where a shape
already exists in the tree, reference it.

**Gaps decided here**: every place the record left open, one bullet "decision · why", and the same as one line in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`.

### 2.3. Names

Modules (the language profile's code target), exported names, the test files: the author's smoke test (≤ 5 checks) or
none when a probe covers the card; the judge's examples file, one test per record example, in example order, named
"<Function> example <N>: <what>" (Go: `Test<Function>Example<N>`; Python: `test_<function>_example_<n>`).

### 2.4. What must not break

The files no card of this phase writes, byte for byte; the test count that stays green; the ripple (tests that pin the
old behaviour, measured by a spike) excluded deck-wide until their judge patches them.

## 3. Acceptance

Built by `morph plan --checks decks/<phase>/checks.json`, narrow to broad, every stage printing `== <stage>`: parse
(per-card config excluding the generation's other targets) → lint on the card's files → `decks/tools/guard.mjs` (layers,
the test-file rules, the example literals of a judge) → the probe (`decks/<phase>/parts/<card>.probe.*`, red per example
with a readable line) → the card's own tests → the full suite → frozen files → no untracked file left. Judge bounds are
derived: min = the examples, max = min + 6. The whole chain is timed on a dry tree: under 250 s.

## 4. Constraints

The project's (module resolution and imports, no `any` or its language's equivalent, stubs from the shared helpers
module only, a test writes only under a temporary directory, pure layers read no clock, randomness or environment, a
card's smoke test ≤ 5 checks, a judge writes only its test file); a file a card writes is in no sibling's slice in the
same generation. Plus the phase's own.

## 7. Out of scope

An explicit list, or the deck sprawls; the later phase that owns each item.

## 8. How to run

```
morph plan --root . --spec contour.yaml --map morph-map.json --component <C> --judge \
  --checks decks/<phase>/checks.json --out decks/<phase>/deck.json
python3 decks/tools/scale_tokens.py decks/<phase>/deck.json 3        # a processor that thinks before it writes
morph deck check --root . --deck decks/<phase>/deck.json             # errors 0
node <binary copy>/dist/cli.js run --root . --deck decks/<phase>/deck.json --processor <processor> --deadline 2400
```

## 9. Pre-registration

Cards and generations, the cards you expect to regenerate and their first red, the bill (forecast and cap),
falsifiable claims.

## 10. What to record

The row of `docs/MEASURE.md` and §11: attempts, first red per burned variant, neighbour-red, judge defects, guard
rejections, lines by hand, max slice bytes, minutes, $.

## 11. Actual

Filled after the gate (preparation numbers) and after the run; a fix gets its own sub-section with every spec change
before/after.

## Spec author checklist before the gate

- Every fixture named by the type the Function takes and by its counted result (§2.1).
- Every illustration checked against the table it illustrates (§2.2).
- Every message pinned exactly or by prefix; nothing environment-dependent verbatim.
- Every judge that calls other Components: their preconditions listed and cited, markers distinct, a harness skeleton
  when the setup is more than a literal, `max_tokens` sized from the expected answer.
- Every slice path exists on disk at plan time; `contour.yaml` is in no slice.
- Every library the code imports is declared (exact version, `uses`, a 2–5 KB digest) and installed by the scaffold
  phase; nothing is fetched by an acceptance.
- `morph plan` exit 0; `morph deck check` errors 0; every acceptance red per example on stubs in a scratch worktree,
  each stub log passing `decks/tools/stubcheck.mjs` (no build/vet/tsc line outside the card's targets), and for a Go
  `--only` deck each stub tree passing `decks/tools/fullvet.mjs` (the `== full` overlay vetted);
  mutants within the cap killed or recorded; chain under 250 s.
- Where `morph` has the `gate` command: the stubs committed at `decks/<phase>/_stubs/`, the references outside the tree,
  and `morph gate --deck … --stubs … --refs …` exit 0 in place of the hand stub play, stubcheck, fullvet and the chain
  timing.
